excerpt: Project that aims to create middle­ware between different MFCs (Material Flow Controller) and  store management systems
---

MFCs (Material Flow Controller) are fully automated systems consisting of high racks, conveyor belts, automatic separation systems and all other sorts of logistics and transport technologies. It offers storage, indexing and retrieving of transport pallets.

MFC are made by different vendors and also each high rack is highly unique in it's structure, it abilities and it's control language. MFC project aims to create middle­ware between different MFC and LISA (or some other store management system). Communicating with MFC is very low level, often binary protocol. Also a lot of security and transmission control and acknowledge protocols must be implemented on top of plain TCP/IP

#### Highlights
* Hardware abstraction of storage architecture
* API that accommodates MFCs from different manufacturers.

### Technologies used
* Java NIO
* Jboss Netty
* JMS
* JMX
